# Getting Started

This is a compilation of machine learning resources aimed to provide people that are interested in learning more about machine learning a starting point. The start of this gives an overview of what machine learning is, gives some examples, and then moves onto more in-depth detail about machine learning. You are not required to have extensive knowledge on mathematics and coding for all of these resources, but does contain material on these to learn for machine learning.
