# Getting Started

This is a compilation of machine learning resources aimed to provide a starting point for people that are interested in learning about machine learning. The start of this gives an overview of what machine learning is, gives some examples, and then moves onto more in-depth detail about machine learning. You are not required to have extensive knowledge on mathematics and coding for all of these resources, but it does contain material on these to learn for machine learning.
